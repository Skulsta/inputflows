        <p>
          I'm a software developer with a background in innovation management. I
          first stumbled upon programming while doing my initial service in the
          army. I was preparing to apply to law school when someone showed me a
          website called{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.codecademy.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            className="border-b hover:text-green-900"
          >
            Codecademy
          </a>
          . Getting code to run after fighting countless Javascript errors was
          such a great feeling that I threw out the law books and applied for a
          degree in informatics instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got introduced to a student organization that promoted
          entrepreneurship and innovation during my first semester, which
          steered me into the startup world. I became the organization leader
          and attended programs such as Early Stage in Bergen, European
          Innovation Academy in Turin, and The Norwegian School of
          Entrepreneurship in San Francisco.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interest in technology and innovation then took me to the
          Department of Informatics at The University of Oslo. They offered a
          master's degree in Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management, which
          neatly tied my previous years together.
