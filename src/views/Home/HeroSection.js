          </h2>
          <p>
            I'm a software developer with a background in innovation management.
            I first stumbled upon programming while doing my initial service in
            the army. I was preparing to apply to law school when someone showed
            me a website called Codecademy.
          </p>
          <p>
            To finally get code to run after fighting countless Javascript
            errors was such a great feeling that it made me throw out the law
            books and apply for a degree in informatics instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my first semester, I got introduced to a student organization
            that promoted entrepreneurship and innovation among students. The
            organization took me on a parallel path into the startup world. I
            became the organization leader and attending programs such as Early
            Stage in Bergen, European Innovation Academy in Turin, and The
            Norwegian School of Entrepreneurship in San Francisco.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interest in technology and innovation then took me to the
            Department of Informatics at The University of Oslo. They offered a
            master's degree in Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management, which
            neatly tied my previous years together.
